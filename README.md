    Using sql arrays to avoid a long select clause

    Using explicit SQL passthru to compute many baseball statistics by team for an excel user(fat data).
    Do not disparage EXCEL users they outnumber us 100 to 1;

    Original topic: Shortening my proc SQL with lots of variables

      Same result in WPS and SAS, but I am not sure the generated code was done before passing to WPS

    This requires Soer Lassens varlist macro and do_over macro.

    INPUT (This is very fast in teradata with 1000 cores)
    ======================================================

     RULE

     Use explicit teradata passthru SQL to compute the min, mean, median and max of 18 variables for excel user.
     (SQL not summary, means, tabulate, report)
